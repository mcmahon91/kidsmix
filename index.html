            <li>A place that will provide stimulation, guidance, supervision and consistency.</li>
            <li>A place where they can all socialise and make new friends.</li>
            <li>A place with a warm and friendly environment.</li>
            <li>A place where staff and carers are dedicated to children.</li>
            <li>A place where staff are tolerant and caring, setting good examples at all times.</li>
